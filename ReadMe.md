# Slingshot

This is the personal project I created for my Video Game Programming course.
There isn't a real objective other than slingshotting balls across the map to gain points by collecting coins and gems to help/hinder you. In the menu, you can change:


## Menu Description

- Slider to control number of life-lines you have (random balls)
- Slider to control number of Red gems
- Slider to control number of Blue gems
- Slider to control number of Green gems
- Slider to control number of Yellow gems

- Slider to control number of coins

The start button to begin gameplay.
